# Real-time processing of GOES data using AWS Kinesis and Streamlit

This project involves setting up a real-time data pipeline to ingest GOES satellite data, process it and display results using Streamlit. AWS Kinesis can be used to stream the data from GOES satellites to AWS, while Streamlit can be used to create user-friendly visualization dashboards of the processed data.
